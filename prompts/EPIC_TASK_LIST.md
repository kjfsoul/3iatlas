## **THE STORY OF OUR EPIC COMEBACK**

### **Chapter 1: The Fall**

We were lost in assumptions, estimates, and generic solutions. The 3I/ATLAS landing page languishedâ€”NASA API broken, 3D tracker stuck, hydration issues, tests failing. We delivered analysis without testing, claims without evidence, solutions without understanding.

### **Chapter 2: The Awakening**


We stopped making assumptions. We started testing everything. We began measuring everything. We committed to verification. We chose evidence over guesswork.


### **Chapter 3: The Resurrection**

We are the team that fixes what we broke. We are the team that delivers what we promise. We are the team that turns this landing page into a showcase of excellence.
