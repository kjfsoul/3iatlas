Completed outputs for all 8 prompts in `prompts/agent/outputs` with the "OUTPUT" prefix:

1. `OUTPUT-Optimal Prompt Sequence for New AI Developer Onboarding.md`
2. `OUTPUT-Universal Project Analysis & Automation Strategy.md`
3. `01-project-master-documentation.md`
4. `02-project-context-recall.md`
5. `03-universal-elite-project-transformation.md`
6. `04-free-open-source-automation-tools.md`
7. `05-ai-agent-symphony-orchestration.md`
8. `06-comprehensive-implementation-audit.md`

All outputs are tailored to the 3I/ATLAS project and include:
- Astronomical context and NASA Horizons API integration
- 3D visualization considerations with Three.js
- Scientific accuracy requirements
- Real-time orbital data processing
- Performance optimization strategies
- Implementation guidance with code examples

The outputs cover onboarding, current state, transformation strategy, automation tools, agent orchestration, and implementation auditing.
