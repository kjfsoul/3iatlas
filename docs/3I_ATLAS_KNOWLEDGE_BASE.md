## Discovery & Designation

### The ATLAS Discovery

On **July 1, 2025**, astronomers using the **Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS)** in Chile detected an unusual object moving through the constellation Sagittarius. Initial observations revealed characteristics that immediately set it apart from typical solar system objects:

- **Hyperbolic trajectory** indicating an origin outside our solar system
- **High velocity** relative to the Sun
- **Active coma formation** suggesting volatile-rich composition
- **Approach angle** inconsistent with objects bound to the Sun

### The "3I" Designation

The designation **3I/ATLAS** follows the International Astronomical Union (IAU) naming convention for interstellar objects:

- **3I** = Third Interstellar object (following 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov)
- **ATLAS** = Discovery survey/telescope name
- **I** prefix specifically denotes "Interstellar" origin

   - Element abundances match old stellar environments

3. **Surface Weathering**
   - Cosmic ray exposure darkening
   - Space weathering patterns

**Potential Age: 7+ Billion Years**
- Older than the Sun (4.6 billion years)
- Older than Earth (4.5 billion years)
- May predate solar system formation
- Witnessed multiple generations of stars

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: What is an interstellar object?**
A: An object that originated outside our solar system, traveling through interstellar space before passing through our cosmic neighborhood. These visitors formed around other stars.

**Q: How do we know 3I/ATLAS is interstellar?**
A: Its hyperbolic orbit (eccentricity > 1.0) mathematically proves it's not bound to the Sun. Its velocity and trajectory confirm it came from interstellar space and will return there.

**Q: Is 3I/ATLAS dangerous to Earth?**
A: No. Its closest approach is 1.8 AU (170 million miles) from Earth—about 700 times farther than the Moon. It poses zero threat to our planet.

**Q: Why is this discovery important?**
A: 3I/ATLAS provides a rare opportunity to study material from another star system without leaving our own. It's like receiving a cosmic message in a bottle, carrying information about distant planetary formation.

### Scientific Questions

**Q: How old is 3I/ATLAS?**
A: Based on its origin in the Milky Way's thick disk, scientists estimate it's over 7 billion years old—potentially the oldest object ever directly observed.

**Q: What is it made of?**
A: Preliminary observations show water ice, carbon compounds, and various volatiles similar to solar system comets, but with potentially different isotopic ratios revealing its extrasolar origin.

**Q: Where did it come from?**
A: The Milky Way's thick disk—a region of old stars. It likely formed in orbit around an ancient star 7+ billion years ago before being ejected into interstellar space.

**Q: How fast is it moving?**
A: Approximately 137,000 mph (221,000 km/h) relative to the Sun. After perihelion, it will accelerate as it exits the solar system.

### Observation Questions

**Q: Can I see 3I/ATLAS with my eyes?**
A: Possibly! At peak brightness in late October 2025, it may reach magnitude 6-7, making it visible from very dark locations. Binoculars or a small telescope greatly improve viewing.

**Q: When is the best time to observe?**
A: Late October 2025, around its closest approach to the Sun (perihelion). The object will be brightest and most active during this period.

**Q: What will it look like?**
A: Through a telescope, it will appear as a small, fuzzy greenish-white patch with possibly a faint tail. It will move noticeably against background stars over hours.

### Future Questions

**Q: Will it ever come back?**
A: No. 3I/ATLAS is on a hyperbolic trajectory that will carry it out of our solar system permanently. It will return to interstellar space and continue its cosmic journey.

**Q: Are there more interstellar objects coming?**
A: Almost certainly! Astronomers estimate dozens may pass through yearly, but most are too faint to detect. Improved surveys like LSST (Vera Rubin Observatory) will find many more.

**Q: Could we send a spacecraft to it?**
A: With current technology, no—it's moving too fast and will soon be too far away. Future missions might intercept similar objects if detected early enough.
