# 3I/ATLAS 5-View Trajectory System - Master Plan

## Overview
Transform the current 3D tracker into a comprehensive 5-view system for 3I/ATLAS visualization, with historical flight path, current moment super-lens, speed simulation, perihelion event, and interactive trajectory plotting.

## 5 Views Specification

### View 1: Historical Flight Path (July 1 - Oct 8, 2025)
- **Purpose**: Show complete journey since discovery
- **Data**: Generated locally using astronomy-engine + orbital elements
- **Features**: 
  - Animated timeline scrubber
  - Speed controls (1x-100x)
  - Date markers for key events
  - Trail persistence showing full path

### View 2: Current Moment Super-Lens (Oct 8, 2025)
- **Purpose**: Freeze-frame of current position with full solar system context
- **Features**:
  - 3I/ATLAS frozen at current position
  - All major solar system bodies (8 planets + Pluto)
  - Asteroid belt visualization
  - Major moons (Jupiter's 4 Galilean, Saturn's Titan, etc.)
  - Star field background
  - Other active comets (if data available)
  - Free camera rotation around 3I/ATLAS
  - Zoom controls for detailed inspection

### View 3: Speed Simulation
- **Purpose**: Experience 3I/ATLAS's velocity from comet's perspective
- **Features**:
  - Camera locked to 3I/ATLAS position
  - Motion blur effects on tail
  - Streaking star field
  - Velocity vector display
  - Speed multiplier controls
  - User can rotate camera around the comet
  - Particle effects showing solar wind interaction

### View 4: Perihelion Event (Oct 28-29, 2025)
- **Purpose**: Dramatic visualization of closest approach to Sun
- **Features**:
  - Time-lapse around perihelion (Oct 28-29)
  - Enhanced solar corona effects
  - Comet tail intensification
  - Heat/radiation visualization
  - Gravitational lensing effects
  - Speed increase visualization
  - Multiple camera angles (Sun perspective, comet perspective, side view)

### View 5: Interactive Trajectory Plotter
- **Purpose**: User can alter 3I/ATLAS's path and see consequences
- **Features**:
  - Full solar system at current moment
  - Draggable 3I/ATLAS position on timeline
  - Real-time physics calculations
  - Impact prediction system
  - Dashboard showing:
    - Velocity vectors
    - Acceleration
    - Gravitational influences
    - Time to impact
    - Energy calculations
  - Multiple scenario presets (Earth impact, Jupiter slingshot, etc.)

## Technical Architecture

### Data Management
- **Historical Data**: Generate once using astronomy-engine, cache in localStorage
- **Current Position**: Update daily via astronomy-engine (no live API calls)
- **Solar System Objects**: Pre-calculate positions for Oct 8, 2025
- **Physics Engine**: Custom n-body simulator for trajectory plotting
