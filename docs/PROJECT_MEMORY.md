## 🚨 CURRENT CRITICAL ISSUE

### React Three Fiber Reconciler Error

**Status**: 🔴 BLOCKING - 3D tracker does not render

**Error**:

```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'ReactCurrentOwner')
at $$$reconciler (react-reconciler/cjs/react-reconciler.development.js:498:46)
at createRenderer (@react-three/fiber/dist/events-776716bd.esm.js:271:77)
```

**Root Cause**: Version incompatibility between:

- React 18.2.0
- @react-three/fiber 8.13.0
- Next.js 15.5.4

**What Works**: Tracker works perfectly in Vite project at:

- `/Users/kfitz/3dsolardeepagent/code_artifacts/3iatlas-flight-tracker/`
- Dev URL: <http://localhost:5173>

**What's Broken**: Same code fails in Next.js project at:

- `/Users/kfitz/3iatlas/`
- Dev URL: <http://localhost:3030>

**Documented Solutions**: See `MIGRATION_TASKS.md` for 7 detailed approaches

**Time Investment**: ~6 hours attempting various R3F versions, all failed

**Recommended Next Step**: Try Task 2 (R3F version 8.16.0) or Task 6 (iframe embed)

---

## 🔧 Current Implementation Status

### ✅ WORKING (DO NOT BREAK)

**Site Infrastructure:**

- ✅ Next.js dev server on port 3030
- ✅ Page structure and layout
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ All routes working

**Printify Integration (CRITICAL - REVENUE SOURCE):**

- ✅ 3I/Atlas products loading
- ✅ Mystic Arcana products loading
- ✅ EDM Shuffle products loading
- ✅ BirthdayGen products loading
- ✅ Product carousels working
- ✅ Pricing and images displaying
- ✅ Social links functional

**Data Files:**

- ✅ trajectory_static.json (1,093 data points)
- ✅ timeline_events.json (events data)
- ✅ Both files load successfully (200 status)

### ❌ BROKEN (NEEDS FIX)

**3D Visualization:**

- ❌ React Three Fiber initialization
- ❌ Canvas rendering
- ❌ All 3D components (depends on R3F)
- ❌ Camera controls
- ❌ Playback controls
- ❌ Telemetry display

**Current Display**: Shows "Loading Enhanced Solar System..." indefinitely

## 📊 Migration History

### What Was Attempted (Jan 22, 2025)

1. **Component Migration** ✅
   - Copied all 13 tracker components from Vite to Next.js
   - Updated imports for Next.js App Router
   - Added dynamic import wrapper
   - Status: Complete

2. **Dependency Updates** ✅
   - Updated package.json with Three.js dependencies
   - Installed @react-three/fiber and @react-three/drei
   - Status: Complete

3. **Type Definitions** ✅
   - Created types/trajectory.ts
   - Added three-jsx.d.ts for JSX types
   - Status: Complete

4. **Data Integration** ✅
   - Copied trajectory_static.json
   - Copied timeline_events.json
   - Status: Complete

5. **Page Integration** ✅
   - Updated app/page.tsx with tracker
   - Preserved all Printify sections
   - Status: Complete

6. **Version Compatibility Testing** ❌
   - Tried React 18.2.0 + R3F 8.13.0 → Failed
   - Tried React 18.2.0 + R3F 8.15.0 → Failed
   - Tried React 19.0.0 + R3F 8.13.0 → Failed (peer dep conflicts)
   - Tried @types/react version fixes → Failed
   - Time spent: 6+ hours
   - Status: Failed, needs different approach

### What Works vs What Doesn't

**Working in Vite Project**:

- ✅ All 3D rendering
- ✅ Camera controls
- ✅ Data loading
- ✅ Playback system
- ✅ View modes

**Broken in Next.js Project**:

- ❌ R3F reconciler initialization
- ❌ Everything that depends on R3F

**Conclusion**: The code is correct. The environment (Next.js + React 18.2.0) is incompatible with R3F 8.x.

## 🎯 Implementation Patterns That Work

### Static Data Pattern (PROVEN)

```typescript
// Pre-generate data with Python
python backend/generate_atlas_trajectory.py

// Load static JSON in frontend
const response = await fetch('/data/trajectory_static.json');
const trajectoryData = await response.json();

// Use 7-day cache policy
if (cacheAge < 7 days) return cached;
```

### Printify Integration (DO NOT MODIFY)

```typescript
// Shop mapping - WORKING, don't touch
const BASES = {
  atlas: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_3IATLAS_BASE,
  arcana: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ARCANA_BASE,
  edm: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_EDM_BASE,
  bday: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BDAY_BASE,
};

// Product fetching - WORKING
<FeaturedRow storeBase={BASES.atlas} />

// URL Generation - FIXED (Jan 22, 2025)
// ProductCarousel now uses toPublicProductUrl() from lib/printify.ts
// Ensures 3I/ATLAS products stay on domain instead of redirecting to printify.me

// Mobile Responsive - FIXED (Jan 23, 2025)
// - Products display in 3-column grid on all devices (was 1-column on mobile)
// - Image heights responsive: h-32 (mobile) vs h-56 (desktop)
// - Text sizes responsive: text-xs (mobile) vs text-sm (desktop)
// - Navigation arrows sized appropriately for mobile
// - 3D Tracker shows informative placeholder on mobile instead of broken iframe
```

### Next.js Dynamic Import Pattern

```typescript
// For client-only components
const Component = dynamic(() => import('./Component'), {
  ssr: false,
  loading: () => <LoadingFallback />,
});
```

## 💡 Development Guidelines (LEARNED THE HARD WAY)

### What Actually Works

1. **Use Local Documentation**
   - ✅ Read PROJECT_MEMORY.md first
   - ✅ Check CURRENT_STATE.md for latest status
   - ✅ Follow MIGRATION_TASKS.md for specific fixes
   - ❌ Don't rely on ByteRover MCP (unreliable during this project)

2. **Incremental Changes**
   - ✅ Make one small change
   - ✅ Test immediately
   - ✅ Commit if working
   - ❌ Don't make 10 changes and hope

3. **Preserve What Works**
   - ✅ Never touch Printify code
   - ✅ Never modify page structure
   - ✅ Never break existing features
   - ❌ Don't "improve" working code

4. **Document Failures**
   - ✅ Record what was tried
   - ✅ Record exact error messages
   - ✅ Record time spent
   - ✅ Know when to request handoff

### When Stuck Protocol

**If blocked for >30 minutes on same issue:**

1. Document exactly what was tried
2. Document exact error messages
3. Write current state to CURRENT_STATE.md
4. Write next steps to MIGRATION_TASKS.md
5. Request handoff with context

**Don't:**

- ❌ Keep trying random fixes for hours
- ❌ Make up data or mock implementations
- ❌ Break working features to fix broken ones
- ❌ Assume memory tools work (they didn't)

---

## 🔄 ByteRover MCP Status (HONEST ASSESSMENT)

### What Was Supposed to Happen

- Store knowledge after completing tasks
- Retrieve knowledge before starting tasks
- Build cumulative project understanding
- Reduce context repetition

### What Actually Happened

- ❌ ByteRover tools were called but knowledge was not persistently available
- ❌ Had to re-explain same context multiple times
- ❌ No evidence of successful knowledge retrieval
- ❌ Added overhead without clear benefit

### Current Policy

**DO NOT DEPEND ON BYTEROVER MCP** for this project.

**Instead:**

- ✅ Use PROJECT_MEMORY.md (this file) as source of truth
- ✅ Update CURRENT_STATE.md with current status
- ✅ Write detailed MIGRATION_TASKS.md for handoffs
- ✅ Use git commits to track progress
- ✅ Use inline code comments for complex logic

### Future Consideration

If ByteRover MCP becomes reliable:

1. Test it on a small, isolated task
2. Verify retrieval actually works
3. Only then integrate into workflow

**For now: Local markdown files are more reliable than external MCPs.**

## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Priority 1: Fix R3F Compatibility (CRITICAL)

**Goal**: Get 3D tracker rendering in Next.js

**Option A** (15 min): Try R3F 8.16.0

```bash
cd /Users/kfitz/3iatlas
npm install @react-three/fiber@8.16.0 @react-three/drei@9.100.0
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
```

**Option B** (30 min): Iframe embed (guaranteed to work)

```bash
# Use working Vite project via iframe
# Keeps code separation clean
# Eliminates compatibility issues
```

**Option C** (1 hour): Minimal R3F debug

```bash
# Start with just a cube
# Add features incrementally
# Find exact breaking point
```

**Decision Point**: If Option A fails, go directly to Option B. Don't waste time on Option C unless specifically requested.

### Priority 2: Visual Polish (AFTER TRACKER WORKS)

1. Re-enable PlanetLocators
2. Enhance comet trail effects
3. Optimize camera smoothing
4. Test all view modes

### Priority 3: Narrative Integration

1. Connect ATLAS Directive narrative
2. Implement Chrono-Token system
3. Add educational content overlays

## 🎓 Hard-Learned Lessons

### NASA Horizons Integration

- ✅ SPK-ID 1004083 requires `DES=1004083` format
- ✅ 6-hour step size works well for comets
- ✅ Pre-generating data is more reliable than live API
- ✅ 7-day cache prevents unnecessary regeneration

### React Three Fiber + Next.js

- ❌ R3F 8.x has compatibility issues with Next.js 15 + React 18
- ❌ Version mismatches cause React reconciler errors
- ❌ Dynamic imports alone don't solve the issue
- ✅ Working in Vite doesn't mean it'll work in Next.js
- ✅ Iframe embed is a valid architectural choice

### Project Management

- ✅ Document failures as thoroughly as successes
- ✅ Know when to request handoff (after 1-2 hours stuck)
- ✅ Local files > external MCPs for reliability
- ✅ Preserve working features above all else
- ❌ Don't assume tools work without verification

## 🎬 Final Notes

### For Next Developer

**Good News:**

- Site structure is correct
- Printify integration works perfectly
- Data files are correct and loading
- Components are well-organized
- Issue is isolated to one compatibility problem

**Bad News:**

- React Three Fiber won't initialize
- Multiple version combinations have been tried
- 6+ hours invested without resolution
- Likely needs architectural decision (iframe vs keep trying)

**Recommendation:**

1. Try MIGRATION_TASKS.md Task 2 (one more R3F version)
2. If that fails, go straight to Task 6 (iframe embed)
3. Don't waste days on this - iframe is a valid solution

**Remember:**

- Working Printify = Revenue
- Broken tracker = Feature (important but not critical)
- Don't break what works to fix what doesn't

- **Production Build Fixed** - React fragment syntax error resolved

✅ **Browser Verified (User Confirmed):**

- Tracker displays in browser after client-side hydration
- Intermittent UI blocking issue identified and resolved
- All interactive controls working consistently

### Implementation Details

**Approach**: Iframe microservices pattern (Option B)
**Vite Tracker**: <http://localhost:5173> (running separately)
**Next.js Site**: <http://localhost:3030> (embeds tracker via iframe)
**Time Taken**: 45 minutes
**Success Rate**: As predicted - architectural approach works, awaiting final browser verification

### Architecture Decision

Chose iframe over direct R3F integration because:

1. R3F compatibility issue persisted after 6+ hours
2. Iframe guarantees compatibility (proven pattern)
3. Clean separation of concerns (Vite vs Next.js)
4. Independent deployment capability
5. No risk to working Printify integration

### Learned

- Git merge conflicts from async agents caused major regression
- Iframe approach is valid architecture, not a workaround
- BabylonJS widget provided valuable reference for required features
- Must verify with actual browser, not just curl (client-side rendering)
- **UI z-index issue**: Canvas and overlays can block dropdown menus
  - Solution: Use inline style `zIndex: 1000+` and `pointerEvents: 'auto'`
  - Tailwind `z-10` class was insufficient for proper layering

### Hard-Learned Lessons Added

- **Z-index layering in 3D apps**: Canvas elements can capture pointer events
  - Always use high z-index values (1000+) for UI controls
  - Add `pointerEvents: 'auto'` to dropdowns to ensure click capture
  - Test ALL interactive elements in actual browser, not just visual rendering

## Update: January 23, 2025, 3:30 AM PST - CRITICAL ISSUES RESOLVED

### Files Changed

- `/src/hooks/usePlanetTextures.ts` - Switched to Suspense-aware useTexture
- `/src/components/SceneContent.tsx` - Fixed mouse mapping and user interaction detection
- `/src/components/Atlas3DTrackerEnhanced.tsx` - Updated help text and made non-interactive
- `/src/components/PlaybackControls.tsx` - Added pause while scrubbing
- `/src/components/Comet3D.tsx` - Added inner glow and distance-reactive emissive

### Status

✅ **Working**: All critical functionality restored

- Textures load immediately on first paint (Suspense-aware)
- Camera controls work properly (LEFT=ROTATE, RIGHT=PAN)
- Ride-along camera respects user interaction
- Timeline slider pauses while scrubbing
- Speed/view dropdowns function correctly
- Comet has enhanced visual effects

❌ **Broken**: None - all reported issues resolved

### Learned

- **Suspense-aware texture loading**: `useTexture` from drei ensures immediate loading
- **User interaction detection**: OrbitControls `start/end` events prevent camera fighting
- **Timeline scrubbing**: Pausing animation loop prevents conflicts
- **Visual enhancements**: Inner glow and distance-reactive emissive add life to comet

### Next Steps

1. ✅ **Manual browser test** - User confirmed tracker displays
2. ✅ **UI controls fixed** - Speed/View dropdowns now clickable
3. ✅ **Production deployment** - Tracker deployed to tracker.3iatlas.mysticarcana.com
4. ✅ **Critical issues resolved** - All reported functionality working
5. ⏳ **Performance monitoring** - Track FPS and memory usage
6. ⏳ **Mobile responsiveness** - Test on smaller screens

**Handoff Ready:** Yes - all context documented, commit created

## Update: January 23, 2025, 2:15 AM PST - Responsive Layout Issue Fixed

### Files Changed (Responsive Layout Fix)

- **PlaybackControls.tsx**: Implemented comprehensive responsive layout solution

### Status

✅ **Responsive Layout Issue Resolved:**

- Fixed controls dropping outside visible canvas area on mobile/web
- Implemented responsive breakpoints for all control elements
- Reduced minimum width from 500px to 320px for mobile compatibility
- Added responsive padding, text sizes, and spacing throughout
- Optimized dropdown positioning and sizing for mobile screens
- Prevented overflow issues across all breakpoints (mobile ≤767px, tablet 768–1023px, desktop ≥1024px)

### Technical Implementation

- **Container Strategy**: Responsive minWidth (320px) with maxWidth (90vw)
- **Dropdown Placement**: Maintained bottom-full positioning with responsive widths
- **Mobile Behavior**: Compact button sizing, shortened labels, reduced gaps
- **Iframe Constraints**: Controls now stay within visible canvas area
- **Breakpoint Support**: sm: (640px+), md: (768px+), lg: (1024px+)

### Responsive Features Added

- **Timeline Slider**: Responsive gaps (gap-2 sm:gap-4), date widths (w-16 sm:w-24 md:w-32)
- **Control Buttons**: Responsive padding (px-2 sm:px-3 py-1.5 sm:py-2), text sizes (text-xs sm:text-sm)
- **Dropdowns**: Responsive widths (w-32 sm:w-40, w-40 sm:w-52)
- **Zoom Controls**: Mobile-optimized with shortened labels (Z vs Zoom)
- **Container Padding**: Responsive padding (p-2 sm:p-3, px-2 sm:px-4 py-3 sm:py-4)

### Issue Resolved

- **Problem**: Bottom control strip dropping outside visible canvas area on mobile/web
- **Root Cause**: Fixed widths and non-responsive layout causing overflow
- **Solution**: Comprehensive responsive design with Tailwind breakpoints
- **Result**: Controls remain visible and accessible across all screen sizes

## Update: January 23, 2025, 1:54 AM PST - Printify Cache Warning Fixed

### Files Changed (Cache Fix)

- **lib/printify.ts**: Modified auth() function to disable caching for large Printify responses

### Status

✅ **Printify Cache Warning Resolved:**

- Fixed "Failed to set fetch cache" warning for Printify API responses >2MB
- Modified `auth()` function to accept `disableCache` parameter
- Set `revalidate: 0` for `getLatestPublishedProducts()` to prevent Next.js caching
- Eliminated cache warning without affecting product loading functionality
- All Printify products continue to load correctly across all 4 brands

### Technical Implementation

- **Cache Control**: `next: disableCache ? { revalidate: 0 } : { revalidate: 60 }`
- **Large Response Handling**: Disabled caching specifically for products API endpoint
- **Performance Impact**: Minimal - products still load quickly without cache
- **Error Resolution**: Eliminated 2,499,191 byte cache limit warning

### Issue Resolved

- **Problem**: Next.js cache warning for Printify responses over 2MB limit
- **Root Cause**: `next: { revalidate: 60 }` trying to cache large product responses
- **Solution**: Conditional cache disabling for large API responses
- **Result**: Clean console output, products load normally

## Update: October 22, 2025, 4:30 PM PDT - Tracker layout reorganized

- Realigned Atlas tracker UI to match four-panel grid: mission timeline and camera control info rows render as centered headers followed by two 4-column content bands (Discovery/Perihelion, Mars Flyby/Jupiter Approach with camera instructions).
- Restored primary canvas prominence with rounded border, embedded telemetry overlay at top-left using live data with compact styling.
- Rebuilt playback row: slider sits directly beneath the canvas with explicit July 1, 2025 → March 31, 2026 range, progress percent display, and centered control buttons (Reset, Play/Pause, Speed, View).
- Dropped old floating timeline/telemetry cards to prevent overlap; playback controls now remain visible instead of hiding behind the canvas.
- Follow-up: mission timeline buttons hook back into event jump logic, speed/view dropdowns render in-place with working selection, zoom buttons restored, and canvas container switched to fixed height so the 3D scene fills the frame without gray padding above the slider.
- Latest: limited speed options to 1x/10x/25x with inline beveled menu, trimmed view selector to True Scale vs Ride With 3I/ATLAS (dropdown stays inside panel), gated zoom controls + instruction styling to True Scale mode, beveled timeline buttons, and reinstated Suspense-driven texture loader so planets render correctly in both views.
