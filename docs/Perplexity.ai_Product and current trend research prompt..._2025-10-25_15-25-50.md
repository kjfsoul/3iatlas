Product and current trend research prompt  
“Act as a real‑time social‑listening and market research assistant. Using up‑to‑date information from social media (TikTok, Instagram, X/Twitter, Reddit) and news sources, identify the top 10 trending themes, memes and emotional drivers related to interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as well as its October 29 2025 perihelion. For each trend, please provide:  
1\. A concise description of the trend with data‑driven evidence (e.g., mentions, sentiment, popular hashtags).  
2\. A creative image‑generation prompt tailored for a generative art model (like Google’s Nanobanana) that reflects the trend’s aesthetics and emotional tone.  
3\. Recommended print‑on‑demand products from Printify’s current catalog that best fit the artwork (e.g., unisex tees, premium posters, vinyl stickers, hoodies, etc.), noting their available variants and average sales data if accessible.  
4\. Projected sales potential for each product‑prompt pairing, based on recent social‑media engagement and comparable product performance.  
5\. Platform recommendations (which social channels are most effective for each trend) with sample marketing copy/hashtags tailored to those platforms.  
6\. At least three additional key metrics or findings per trend (e.g., demographic insights, geographic hotspots, engagement rates, or relevant news articles).  
Also include an inventory overview: a summary of existing 3I/ATLAS‑themed products already available through major POD marketplaces (such as Etsy, Redbubble or Printify), along with any publicly available sales figures or bestseller rankings.”
