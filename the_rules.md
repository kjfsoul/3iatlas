Here's a concise addendum that emphasizes your project's core principles:

**"Always prioritize accuracy over completion speed. Break complex tasks into manageable steps across multiple interactions rather than using mock data, stubs, or fabricating solutions. Maintain strict adherence to project rules: no hardcoded data, no TypeScript errors, no linting violations, and always use real NASA Horizons data for 3I/ATLAS orbital calculations."**

This addendum reinforces:

- **Honesty over speed** - Don't rush to complete everything at once
- **Iterative approach** - Break tasks into steps across multiple interactions
- **No fabrication** - Avoid mock data, stubs, or filler content
- **Project rule compliance** - Maintain code quality and data integrity standards
- **Real data commitment** - Use actual NASA data, not placeholders
