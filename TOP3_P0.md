# Top 3 P0 Tasks - 3I/ATLAS Critical Fixes

*Priority: CRITICAL - Must be completed TODAY before any other development*

## ðŸš¨ P0-001: Fix Speed Simulation View Crashes

### Why Now
**CRITICAL USER EXPERIENCE ISSUE** - The Speed Simulation view is one of the core features that showcases the 3I/ATLAS experience from the comet's perspective. Currently, it crashes on initialization, preventing users from experiencing this unique viewpoint. This is blocking the primary value proposition of the application.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Speed view loads without crashing on initialization
- [ ] Animation loop runs at 60fps target with FrameGuard protection
- [ ] No NaN position/velocity errors in console
- [ ] Starfield renders correctly without ground-plane artifacts
- [ ] Camera controls work smoothly (rotate around comet)
- [ ] Velocity vector HUD displays correctly
- [ ] Motion blur effects work without performance degradation

### Technical Details
**Root Cause:** NaN positions or rendering before atlasData is ready
**Files to Fix:**
- `components/views/SpeedSimulationView.tsx` - Main crash source
- `components/utils/frame-guard.ts` - Performance protection
- `lib/astronomy-engine-source.ts` - Data validation

**Key Fixes Needed:**
1. Gate scene initialization on `atlasData.length > 0`
2. Validate per-frame positions; skip frame on invalid data
3. Ensure materials compatible (no `emissive` in MeshBasicMaterial)
4. Call OrbitControls.update() each frame
5. Disable/clip starfield near z=0 plane to remove "bottom star river"

### Estimate: 4 hours
**Breakdown:**
- 1 hour: Debug and identify crash root cause
- 2 hours: Implement data validation and scene guards
- 1 hour: Fix starfield artifacts and performance issues

## ðŸš¨ P0-002: Fix Trajectory Plotter View Crashes

### Why Now
**INTERACTIVE PHYSICS SIMULATION** - The Trajectory Plotter is the most advanced feature, allowing users to drag the comet and see real-time physics calculations. This is a key differentiator that demonstrates the scientific accuracy of the application. Currently broken due to geometry NaN errors.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Trajectory view loads without geometry NaN errors
- [ ] Drag comet functionality works smoothly
- [ ] Trajectory line updates in real-time during drag
- [ ] Physics dashboard updates correctly with new positions
- [ ] Scenario buttons (Earth impact, Jupiter slingshot) work
- [ ] No THREE.js boundingSphere errors
- [ ] Integration loop handles edge cases gracefully

### Technical Details
**Root Cause:** Geometry NaN or invalid updates in trajectory calculation
**Files to Fix:**
- `components/views/TrajectoryPlotterView.tsx` - Main crash source
- `lib/trajectory-calculator.ts` - Physics calculations
- `lib/physics-engine.ts` - Integration loop

**Key Fixes Needed:**
1. After setFromPoints, computeBoundingSphere in try/catch
2. Break integration loop if currentPos becomes non-finite
3. Ensure scenario presets don't set zero/NaN velocities
4. Clamp distances to â‰¥1e-6 AU; softening Îµ=1e-3 AU in physics
5. Ensure returned `VectorData.velocity` uses { vx, vy, vz }

### Estimate: 3 hours
**Breakdown:**
- 1 hour: Debug geometry NaN errors and identify root cause
- 1.5 hours: Implement physics validation and error handling
- 0.5 hours: Fix scenario presets and velocity calculations

## ðŸš¨ P0-003: Implement Unified Playback State Management

### Why Now
**ARCHITECTURAL FOUNDATION** - Multiple state sources are causing conflicts and inconsistent behavior across all views. This is a fundamental architectural issue that affects every interactive feature. Without unified state management, all other fixes will be temporary patches.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Single source of truth for isPlaying, speed, currentIndex in Atlas3DTrackerEnhanced
- [ ] All views receive state as props, no per-view shadow states
- [ ] Play/Pause toggles work consistently across all views
- [ ] Speed changes affect step rate uniformly
- [ ] Timeline slider scrubs without re-initializing scene
- [ ] State changes propagate immediately to all views
- [ ] No state conflicts or race conditions

### Technical Details
**Root Cause:** Multiple state sources causing conflicts
**Files to Fix:**
- `components/Atlas3DTrackerEnhanced.tsx` - Main state source
- `components/views/AtlasViewsContainer.tsx` - State propagation
- `components/views/HistoricalFlightView.tsx` - Timeline handlers
- All view components - Remove shadow states

**Key Fixes Needed:**
1. Move all playback state to Atlas3DTrackerEnhanced
2. Pass state down as props to all views
3. Remove per-view state management
4. Implement consistent state update patterns
5. Ensure state changes trigger proper re-renders

### Estimate: 3 hours
**Breakdown:**
- 1 hour: Analyze current state management and identify conflicts
- 1.5 hours: Refactor to unified state management
- 0.5 hours: Test state propagation across all views

## ðŸŽ¯ Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Week 1)
1. **P0-001** - Fix Speed Simulation View Crashes (4 hours)
2. **P0-002** - Fix Trajectory Plotter View Crashes (3 hours)
3. **P0-003** - Implement Unified Playback State Management (3 hours)

**Total: 10 hours**

### Success Metrics
- [ ] All 5 views load without crashing
- [ ] All buttons functional (Play/Pause, Speed, Camera controls)
- [ ] All planets and artifacts visible and properly sized
- [ ] Correct rotation and orbital motion
- [ ] Expected speed and time progression
- [ ] No console errors during normal operation
- [ ] 60fps target maintained during animation
- [ ] User can complete full workflow without issues

### Testing Strategy
1. **Manual Testing:** Test each view individually and in sequence
2. **Performance Testing:** Monitor FrameGuard telemetry
3. **Error Testing:** Check console for errors during operation
4. **User Testing:** Complete user workflow from start to finish

### Risk Mitigation
- **Backup Strategy:** Create feature branches for each fix
- **Rollback Plan:** Keep working version available
- **Testing Plan:** Test each fix individually before integration
- **Monitoring:** Use FrameGuard telemetry to catch regressions
