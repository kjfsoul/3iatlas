[2025-10-15T04:27:45Z] Decision: Apply ORBIT_SCALE and comet orientation/tail fixes in components/views/HistoricalFlightView.tsx. Reason: Visual clustering made planets indistinct; comet color/tail were incorrect; animation unclear. Impact: Clear separation of orbits, project-correct comet visuals, tail consistently points away from Sun, improved readability; no API changes. Evidence: commit b9f39dd, build/typecheck/lint passed.
