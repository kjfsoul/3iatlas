## üìã Task Management Workflow

### Task Assignment

1. **Architect** reviews task requirements and creates technical specification
2. **Implementer** receives specification and implements solution
3. **QA** tests implementation and validates quality
4. **Architect** reviews final implementation and approves merge

### Quality Gates

- **Code Quality:** All code passes linting and type checking
- **Performance:** 60fps target maintained, no performance regressions
- **Testing:** All tests pass, including E2E and performance tests
- **Documentation:** Code is properly documented and commented
- **Architecture:** Implementation follows architectural guidelines

### Escalation Process

1. **Implementer** encounters architectural decision ‚Üí Escalate to **Architect**
2. **QA** finds critical bug ‚Üí Escalate to **Implementer** and **Architect**
3. **Architect** identifies performance issue ‚Üí Escalate to **Implementer**
4. **Any agent** finds security issue ‚Üí Escalate to **Architect** immediately

---

## üö® Critical Rules (NEVER VIOLATE)

### 1. NO Mock Data, NO Stubs, NO Hardcoded Values

```typescript
// ‚ùå WRONG - Never do this
const mockOrbitalData = {
  position: { x: 1, y: 2, z: 3 },
  velocity: { x: 0.1, y: 0.2, z: 0.3 }
};

// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Always use real API calls
const response = await fetch('/api/horizons/ephemeris?COMMAND=1004083');
const realData = await response.json();
```

### 2. NO Changes to Printify Logic

- **Never modify** `FeaturedRow.tsx` without explicit request
- **Never modify** `printify.ts` without explicit request
- **All work** should be in new 3D tracker files only

### 3. NO TypeScript Errors

- **Strict mode enabled** - no implicit any
- **All types defined** - no "any" types
- **Run typecheck** before committing: `npm run typecheck`

### 4. Performance Requirements

- **60fps target** for 3D visualization
- **Use FrameGuard** for performance monitoring
- **Dispose resources** properly
- **Optimize for mobile** devices

### 5. Data Validation

- **Validate all API responses** before use
- **Check for NaN values** in 3D calculations
- **Handle edge cases** gracefully
- **Log errors** for debugging
